This repository is used to store any work done that was related to 
the Odin Project. Although most of the work on here is mostly beginner-level
projects, this was done primarily to practice Git and get into the habit
of managing version control.

Whoever is reading this, there's probably not much to see here but feel free
to browse one random person's journey to learning web development
